# Product Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to develop an open-source distributed messaging system, with a special emphasis on privacy. The system is based on a distributed network of relays that facilitate the secure transmission of messages using the Nostr protocol for identity management.

## 2. Overview

A distributed messaging system that offers:

- Private and secure communication with end-to-end encryption
- Comprehensive data and metadata protection
- Nostr-based authentication
- Open and extensible architecture
- Intuitive interface

## 3. Key Features

- Secure and decentralized messaging architecture
- Key management based on the Nostr protocol
- Hybrid encryption of messages and metadata
- Horizontal scalability through distributed relays
- Privacy through data volume

## 4. System Components

- Clients (Sender and Receiver)

  - Frontend: React with Vite
  - Mobile App: React Native (for hybrid development)
  - Shared Logic: Rust/WASM for cryptography (reusable on both platforms)
  - Use of Nostr keys (npub/nsec)

- Relays

  - Backend: Golang with Gin framework
  - Infrastructure: Docker for horizontal scalability

- Distributed database

  - CouchDB or similar
  - Replication system for synchronization

## 5. OpenSource Aspects

- Project Governance

  - License: MIT License
  - Public repository on GitHub
  - Contribution system through Pull Requests
  - Community code review process
  - Improvement proposal system (similar to NIPs)

- Documentation

  - Contribution guides
  - Code standards
  - Detailed technical documentation
  - Examples and use cases
  - Implementation guides

- Community
  - Discord/Matrix channel for developers
  - Technical discussion forum
  - Periodic community meetings
  - Voting process for significant changes

## 6. Security and Privacy

- AES-GCM encryption for messages
- ECC for session key encryption
- Delegation of sending for anonymity
- Disposable keys for greater privacy

## 7. Integrations

- Documented APIs for extensions
- Hooks for community plugins

## 8. Success Metrics

- Number of active users
- Volume of messages processed
- Average message delivery time
- Encryption/decryption success rate
- Adoption of advanced features
- Community Contributions
- Security audit results
- Relays Uptime
- User satisfaction
