# Additional technical aspects

## Anonymity through delegation of sending

- The system will allow the functions of encryption and sending messages to be
  separated. A user Y can encrypt a message for Z, while X uploads it to the server, thus
  making it difficult to trace the communication chain and strengthening the privacy of the
  participants.

## Disposable keys for greater privacy

- The system allows for the generation of temporary key pairs for communications,
  avoiding permanent identity binding and protecting against possible hostile relays.

## Incentives for relay operators

- Thanks to the integration between Lightning Network (LN) Network and Nostr, relay
  administrators can monetize specific services, creating a sustainable ecosystem of
  nodes that maintain the distributed network.
