# Introduction

The main purpose of this project is to develop a distributed messaging system, with a special emphasis on privacy. To achieve this goal, we will mix the "hiding in the crowd" advantage with an encryption that covers both the content of messages and the associated metadata, thus ensuring the absolute confidentiality of communications.

The system architecture is based on a distributed network of relays that facilitate the secure transmission of messages without compromising user privacy. Each message and its associated metadata are protected using advanced encryption techniques, ensuring that only legitimate receivers can decrypt the content.

A key aspect of this project is the strategic use of the Nostr protocol for identity management and user authentication. By leveraging the private and public keys used by Nostr, each participant in the system can be uniquely identified, thus simplifying authentication and encryption processes. This integration will eliminate the need to manually generate and distribute keys, optimizing the user experience and strengthening the overall security of the system.

The system is designed with the ability to be extended for future integrations, through its open source code. However, the main focus remains on providing a messaging platform that guarantees maximum privacy and security in communications.

In short, this project seeks to develop a distributed messaging platform that prioritizes privacy and security, relying on cutting-edge technologies such as the Nostr protocol. The ultimate goal is to offer users a robust and decentralized alternative to communicate securely and efficiently in an increasingly challenging digital environment.
